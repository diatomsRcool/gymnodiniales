1. Gymnodinium absumens Schiller 1957 – This species was described by Schiller from several individuals collected in Lake Neusiedl, a freshwater lake in Central Europe [15].  He included five drawings of this species and a 152 word description in German that gave quantitative cell size measurements.  It has not been observed since.
2. Gymnodinium achromaticum Lebour 1917 – This species was described by Lebour based on a single cell found in the estuarine waters of Plymouth Sound, England [16].  She drew two images of the cell, ventral and side view.  No quantitative measurements are available in her 40 word description in English.  This species was referred to in several publications, but was not seen again until 1936 off the coast of Massachusetts by Lackey [17].  It was seen again in 1938 in brackish waters in Belgium [18] .  Conrad and Kufferath [18] provided no new images nor morphological features, but provided some details of the environment in which the cell was found.  The earliest quantitative measurements appeared in Kofoid & Swezy [19] who presumably calculated them from the original Lebour drawings.  The Kofoid & Swezy English description was much longer than the Lebour description, which raises a question as to the validity of the Kofoid and Swezy account, considering there is no evidence for new observations.  In 1925, Lebour republished her description of G. achromaticum with the Kofoid and Swezy [19] measurements despite not having observed the species again [20].  Schiller published a German account of the species without new observations [21].  It wasn’t until the 1960s that G. achromaticum was again seen in Plymouth Sound [22].  Margalef reported seeing G. achromaticum in the NW Mediterranean [23].  In 1982, Dodge published a short account of G. achromaticum with a new image, presumably redrawn from Lebour [24].  The species was reported from the Aegean Sea in 2007 [25]. Two observations have been reported to GBIF.  There are three unique drawings available depicting this species and no photographs.
3. Gymnodinium achroum Schiller 1957 - This species was described by Schiller from few individuals collected in the freshwater Lake Neusiedl [15].  He included two drawings of this species, cell size measurements and a 165 word description in German.  It has not been observed since.
4. Gymnodinium acutiusculum Okolodkov 1997 – This species was described by Okolodkov based on a single individual collected in the Greenland Sea [26].  There is one drawing in his 268 word, English description and no photographs.  Cell measurements and some habitat information were given.  This species has been observed once and no additional information can be found.
5. Gymnodinium adriaticum (Schmarda) Kofoid & Swezy 1921 – This species was initially described as Peridinium adriaticum by Schmarda [27] who included 12 drawings and a 126 word description in German.  Many individuals were found in salt pools near Trieste, Italy.  He observed the species on two occasions, once in Trieste and again in Venice.  It has not been observed since its discovery, despite being reported in the literature.  Diesing transferred this species to Heteraulacus [28] and later to Heteroaulax [29].  Kofoid & Swezy finally placed it within Gymnodinium [19].  Very little information is available on G. adriaticum.  Peridinium adriaticum Schmarda 1846 should not be confused with the homonym Peridinium adriaticum Broch 1910 which has been renamed P. brochi [19]. 
6. Gymnodinium aequatoriale Hasle 1960 – This species was described by Hasle from hundreds of individuals collected from the equatorial Pacific Ocean [30].  She included five drawings, cell measurements and a 228 word, English and Latin description.  It has one observation in GBIF. 
7. Gymnodinium aeruginosum Stein 1883 – This species was described by Stein using samples from an Austrian pond [31].  He gives no explicit text description, but does include four figures and descriptive figure captions in German.  Stein does not include quantitative measurements from direct observations, but those can be found in later publications [31–36]. This species has been reported numerous times since its first description and seems to have a cosmopolitan distribution in freshwater ponds, bogs and rivers from oligo- to eutrophic waters in the temperate zone.  Klebs reported this species from Java [37].  This species has numerous reports in excess of observations due to its appearance in many protistan guidebooks.  In addition to the original four drawings, 14 additional drawings and two published photographs are available.  Popovsky & Pfiester declared G. viride Penard 1891, G. acidotum Nygaard 1949, G. p. dohrni Wawrik and G. campaniforme Popovsky 1971 to be synonymous with G. aeruginosum Stein 1883 [12].  G. campaniforme Popovsky was described from material collected from a drinking-water reservoir in the Czech Republic [38].  G. viride Penard was described from Switzerland [39].  G. acidotum Nygaard was described from Danish ponds [40]. G. p. dohrni Wawrik was described from Austrian fish ponds [41].  Of these three, G. campaniforme is the only one that has not been observed since its original description outside the synonymy. The Popofsky and Pfiester synonymy has been largely disregarded. In 2014, Gymnodinium acidotum was used as the basionym for Nusuttodinium acidotum (Nygaard) Takano & Horiguchi (Takano et al. 2014). Gymnodinium aeruginosum itself was used as the basionym for Nusuttodinium aeruginosum (Stein) Takano & Horiguchi (Takano et al. 2014).  
8. Gymnodinium aesculum Baumeister 1943 – This species was described by Baumeister from German waters in a 552 word description in German and has not been observed again [42].  The description included four drawings, some cell measurements and was based on several individuals.
9. Gymnodinium aestivale Skvortzov 1968 – This species was described by Skvotzov from Northern Mancuria, China [43].  His 69 word, Latin and English description was accompanied by length and width measurements of the cell and one drawing.  This species has not been observed since description.
10. Gymnodinium affine Dogiel 1906 – This species was described by Dogiel from cysts in the Gulf of Naples [44].  His 433 word description in German contained four drawings.  This species has not been observed since its original description.
11. Gymnodinium agaricoides Campbell 1973 – This species was described by Campbell from the polyhaline portion of Gales Creek, North Carolina, USA by observing several individuals in eight samples [45].  He included three drawings and some quantitative measurements in his 216 word description in English.  It has since been observed in Greek waters [46] and the Chesapeake Bay [47].  
12. Gymnodinium agiliforme Schiller 1928 – This species was described by Schiller from the Adriatic Sea [48].  He gave four drawings in his 177 word, Latin and German description which also contained some quantitative information about size of the cells and their habitat.  He reported the species again with no new observations [21].  In 1982 this species was observed in the subarctic Pacific [49].  In 1998 the species was observed in Russian waters [36].  It was observed in Romania [50], Spain [51] and the Sea of Okhostk [52].  There are 281 observations of G. agiliforme within the GBIF database.  
13. Gymnodinium alaskensis Bursa 1963 – This species was described by Bursa from small freshwater ponds near Barrow, Alaska [53]. He viewed several cells and gave three drawings in his 316 word description in English that includes quantitative and qualitative cell morphology information.  This species has not been observed since its first description.
14. Gymnodinium allophron Larsen 1994 – Larsen described this species from Hobsons Bay (marine waters), Australia using eight living cells [54].  His 234 word, Latin and English description included four photos and one drawing.  The description also contained quantitative measurements of cell size.  It has not been observed since.
15. Gymnodinium amphiconicoides Schiller 1957 – Schiller described this species from material collected from freshwater Lake Neusiedl [15].  He observed at least two individuals, because he gives a range of measurements, but does not specify how many cells he observed.  Three drawings were given in his 104 word description in German.  This species has not been observed since.
16. Gymnodinium amphityphlum Larsen 1994 – Larsen described this species from marine, Australian waters [54].  He observed over 20 living cells to draft his 353 word, Latin and English description.  He gives three photos, one drawing and quantitative measurements of cell size.  This species has not been observed since.
17. Gymnodinium amphora Kofoid & Swezy 1921 – This species was described by Kofoid  and Swezy from La Jolla, California [19].  They observed only one cell and gave two high quality drawings, quantitative measurments of morphology and a 544 word description in English.  The species was reported by Schiller with no new observations or images [21].  It has been observed in the Mediterranean Sea [55] and the Gulf of Mexico [56].
18. Gymnodinium amplinucleum Campbell 1973 – This species was described by Campbell from the polyhaline section of Gales Creek in North Carolina, USA [45].  At least two individuals were observed in one sample.  Campbell gave two drawings and a 210 word description in English containing quantitative measurements of cell size.  This species has also been observed in the Chesapeake Bay [47].
19. Gymnodinium antarcticum Thessen, Patterson and Murray nom. nov. See Gymnodinium frigidum Balech 1965.
20. Gymnodinium arcticum Wulff 1919 – This species was described by Wulff from the Barents Sea [57].  He gave four drawings and a 126 word description in German.  He also gave a range of cell measurements so it is assumed that he saw at least two cells.  Schiller and Lebour reported G. arcticum, but did not observe it [20,21].  However, the species has been observed in the Strait of Georgia [58], near Japan [59], in Plymouth Sound [60], near Svalbard [61], off the east coast of the USA [62], in the Aegean Sea [63], the Russian Arctic [64], the Chesapeake Bay [65], in the Black Sea [66] and near Russia [36].  There are 136 records of this species in GBIF.  There are a total of nine published drawings available and no photographs.
21. Gymnodinium arcuatum Kofoid 1931 – This species was described by Kofoid [67].  In his 297 word English description, he does not give a range for the cell length and width, but does state that the species was common in Mutsu Bay, Japan.  We conclude that while Kofoid saw many of this species, the actual description and measurements are based on only one cell.  In 1933, Schiller reported the species without making new observations [21].  Sixty years later, Konovalova observed the species and gave two new drawings[36].  It was also observed in the Strait of Taiwan [68] and in the Black Sea [69].  There are three drawings and no photographs available.
22. Gymnodinium arenicolus Dragesco 1965 – This species was described by Dragesco in from the sands off Roscoff, France [70].  His 885 word description in French was based on many cells and included nine drawings and cell measurements.  This species has also been known as G. arenicola and G. arenicolum (Appendix B).  It has been observed in British waters [60].
23. Gymnodinium armoricanum Villeret 1953 – This species was described by Villeret from Lande d’Ouée, France [71].  He gave a 192 word description in French including cell measurements, habitat information and six drawings.  This species has not been observed since its description.
24. Gymnodinium atomatum Larsen 1994 – Larsen described this species based on observations of six living cells from marine, Australian waters [54] as part of a broader survey [72].  His 296 word, English and Latin description contained two photographs, one drawing and cell morphology measurements.  This species has not been observed since its original description.
25. Gymnodinium attenuatum Kofoid & Swezy 1921 – This species was described by Kofoid and Swezy from material collected off La Jolla, California [19].  Their 464 word, Enlgish-language description was based on observations of three individuals.  They provided one line drawing and quantitative measurements of cell morphology.  Schiller reported the species, but made no new observations [21].  This species has been observed in the Mediterranean Sea [55].
26. Gymnodinium aurantium Campbell 1973 – This species was described by Campbell from the mesohaline portion of Gales Creek, North Carolina, USA [45].  He provided a 167 word description in English with cell size measurments and four drawings.  There is possibly some confusion between this species and Pfiesteria piscicida because the details needed to distinguish them are not observable via light microscopy [73].  This species has been observed in the Chesapeake Bay [74].  
27. Gymnodinium auratum Kofoid & Swezy 1921 – This species was described by Kofoid and Swezy from observations of one cell [19].  It was collected off La Jolla, California. The authors gave a 562 word description in English with two drawings and quantitative cell measurements.  Schiller reported the species with no new observations [21].  It has been observed in the Gulf of Mexico [56], Mediterranean Sea [55], the Mexican Pacific [75] and the Black Sea [76].
28. Gymnodinium aureolum (Hulburt) Hansen 2000 – This species was originally described as Gyrodinium aureolum by Hulburt from marine waters near the Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA area [77].  Campbell observes the cells in the polyhaline portion of Gales Creek, North Carolina, USA in 1973 [45].  It was then transferred to Gymnodinium by Hansen based on observations of laboratory cultures [78].  Hansen provides a 1000+ word description with 18 drawings and photographs.  The morphology and phylogeny of this species was thoroughly treated by Tang et al. using cells cultured from the Elizabeth River, Virginia, USA [79].  This group provided additional photographs of this species.  Cultures are available from the Cawthron Institute Culture Collection of Microalgae and held at the University of Tasmania School of Plant Science Algal Culture Collection.  
29. Gymnodinium aureum Kofoid & Swezy 1921 – This species was described by Kofoid and Swezy from the marine waters near La Jolla, California [19].  Their 632 word description in English was based on observations of two cells and included quantitative morphological information.  Schiller reported the species with no new observations [21].  Since its description, it has been observed in New Jersey waters [80], the Yucutan, Mexico [81], the Mediterranean Sea [55] and one cell was observed in San Diego Bay [82].  Gyrodinium aureum was later synonymized with this species [19].  
30. Gymnodinium australe Playfair 1919 –This species was described by Playfair from freshwater in Sydney, Australia by observing many individuals [33].  His 300 word, Latin and English description included cell measurements and three drawings.  A previous name for this species is Gymnodinium fuscum var. cornifax (Schilling) Playfair.  This species has been reported by Day et al. [83].  It has been observed in multiple locations across New South Wales, Australia [33].
31. Gymnodinium australense Ruinen 1938 – This species was described by Ruinen from Australia by observing many cells [84].  The description is 193 words long and in German.  Ruinen gave four drawings and cell measurements.  This species has not been seen since its description and no photographs are available.
32. Gymnodinium austriacum Schiller 1933 – This species was described by Schiller from freshwater Lake Attersee in Austria [21].  His description was 119 words long and in German with six drawings and was based on observations from 45 cells.  He included cell size measurements and habitat information.  Popovsky and Pfiester synonymized G. tridentatum Schiller, G. cruciatum Thompson, G. thompsonii (Thompson) Kiselev, G. waltzii Baumeister, G. titubens Christen and G. autumnale Christen with this species [12].  However, the images for G. austriacum Schiller and G. cruciatum Thompson do not resemble each other, meaning that the Popovsky and Pfiester synonymy could be wrong.  This species has been observed in Japanese waters [34], Ohio, USA [85] and the Czech Republic [86].
33. Gymnodinium autumnale Skvortzov 1968 – This species was described by Skvortzov from Northern Manchuria, China [43]. His 109 word, Latin and English description included cell measurements and one drawing.  This species should not be confused with G. autumnale Christen 1959 which has been synonymized with Gymnodinium austriacum [21].  This species has not been observed since its description.
34. Gymnodinium baccatum Balech 1965 – This species was described by Balech from Antarctica by observing many individuals [87].  His 331 word description in English was accompanied by two drawings and contained cell size measurements.  In 1976 Balech again observed the species and provided another drawing [88].  There is one record of this species in GBIF.  This species has been observed in the Mediterranean Sea [55].
35. Gymnodinium baicalense Antipova 1955 – This species was described from Lake Baikal, Russia and is endemic to this area [89].  The 315 word, Russian description gives quantitative cell size measurements and three drawings.  This species has been observed numerous times in Lake Baikal, Russia [90], but nowhere else to date.  Later work provided fuller statements of cell morphology and life cycle, stating that Gymnodinium baicalense var. minor Antipova is really a life stage of G. baicalense Antipova [91].  Published drawings and photographs are available.  Five sequences are available in GenBank under the name Gymnodinium sp. (FJ024300, FJ024301, FJ024302, FJ024303, FJ024304).  Phylogenetic analysis shows it is most closely related to Gymnodinium aureolum (Hulburt) Hansen [92].
36. Gymnodinium baumeisteri Schiller 1957 – This species was described by Schiller from freshwater Lake Neusiedl, Austria [15].  He did not specify how many cells were observed to write the description, but since a range of measurements were given for the length and width we can assume he observed at least two cells.  His 224 word description in German was accompanied by four drawings.  This species has not been observed since its description.
37. Gymnodinium biciliatum Ohno 1911 – This species was described by Ohno from a freshwater pond in Japan [93].  His 73 word description in German was offset by the 37 drawings.  This species was unique in the presence of three flagella, two of which were longitudinal.  Kofoid and Swezy discussed the possibility that the appearance of two flagella was an optical illusion caused by rapid movement of the flagella in living cells [19].  Schiller reported the species with no new observations [21].  In 1970, Bicudo and Skvortzov observed G. biciliatum in Brazilian waters, but make a point to mention that their cells definitely had one longitudinal flagellum [94].  Popovsky and Pfiester also reported the species, but say nothing about the flagella [12].  They stated that the species has been observed in Japan and South America.
38. Gymnodinium biconicum Schiller 1928 – This species was described by Schiller from the Adriatic Sea [48].  He did not specify how many cells were observed to write the description, but there must have been at least two.  His 92 word, Latin and English description included cell measurements and one drawing.  Schiller reported the species again but with no new observations [21].  Wood observed the species in Australian waters [95].  It has been observed in the Gulf of Mexico [56], the Black Sea [66], the Mediterranean Sea [55] and on the east coast of the USA [62].  This species has 14 records listed in GBIF.  
39. Gymnodinium bicorne Kofoid & Swezy 1921 – This species was described by Kofoid and Swezy from La Jolla, California, USA [19].  Their 560 word description in English was based on one individual and was accompanied by two detailed drawings and morphological measurements.  The species was observed again by Wailes, but was labeled as “scarce” [58].  This species has been seen in the tropical Atlantic [96].
40. Gymnodinium bifurcatum Kofoid & Swezy 1921 – This species was described by Kofoid and Swezy from marine waters near La Jolla, California, USA [19].  Their 690 word description in English was based on one individual and was accompanied by two detailed drawings.  They give an extensive, quantitative morphological characterization of the single observed cell.  This species was reported by Schiller despite having no new observations [21].  It has not been observed since its first description.
41. Gymnodinium bilobatum van Meel 1969 – This species was described by Van Meel in from Belgium [97].  His 146 word description in French included two drawings and was based on one individual.  Cell size measurements were given.  This species has not been observed since its description.
42. Gymnodinium birotundatum van Goor 1925 – This species was described by Van Goor from oligohaline Dutch waters [98].  He does not specify the number of cells used to craft the description, but gives a range for length and width, so we can assume there were at least two cells involved.  The description was over 1000 words long and included one drawing, cell size measurements and habitat description.  Conrad and Kufferath observed this species in mesohaline waters in Belgium [18].  It has also been observed in British waters [60].
43. Gymnodinium bisaetosum Lindemann 1928 – This species was described by Lindemann from a German  lake [99]. His 61 word description in German contained one drawing and no cell measurements.  It was described entirely from cysts and has not been observed since.
44. Gymnodinium boguensis Campbell 1973 – This species was described by Campbell from Gales Creek, North Carolina, USA by observing at least two cells [45].  The 138 word description in English has two drawings and cell morphology measurements.  It has been observed in the Chesapeake Bay [65].
45. Gymnodinium bonaerense Akselman 1985 – This species was described by Akselman in from the coast of Argentina [100].  His 1000+ word, Latin and Spanish description includes quantitative information about cell morphology and habitat.  He included three drawings and three photographs.  It has not been observed in the field since its description; however, type material was deposited at the National Institute of Fisheries Research and Development in Argentina (INIDEP).  The authors cannot confirm that this material is available to other researchers.
46. Gymnodinium caerulescens Schiller 1957 – This species was described by Schiller from freshwater Lake Neusiedl, Austria [15].  His 92 word description in German was based on several individuals and was accompanied by two drawings.  He gave some quantitative cell measurements.  It has not been observed since.
47. Gymnodinium campaniforme Popovsky 1971 – This species was described by Popovsky from material collected from a drinking-water reservoir in the Czech Republic [38]. In 1990, Popovsky & Pfiester synonymized this species with Gymnodinium aeruginosum Stein. This synonymy is commonly rejected and now G. aeruginosum is a synonym of Nusuttodinium aeruginosum.
48. Gymnodinium campbelli Thessen, Patterson & Murray 2012 - Campbell gave an account of a species that he called Gymnodinium translucens from the polyhaline portion of Gales Creek, North Carolina, USA [45].  His account was accompanied by a drawing that does not match the drawings in Kofoid and Swezy’s description of G. translucens.  As we think Campbell used this name by mistake, we have (below) re-named this species Gymnodinium campbelli Thessen, Patterson & Murray. This species has been observed in the Chesapeake Bay [47].     
49. Gymnodinium canus Kofoid & Swezy 1921 – This species was described by Kofoid and Swezy from a single cell found near La Jolla, California [19].  Their 650 word description in English was accompanied by three detailed drawings and quantitative morphological details.  Schiller reported the species in German with no new observations [21].  It has been observed in the Mediterranean [55] and the Black Sea (http://phyto.bss.ibss.org.ua/wiki/Gymnodinium_canus).
50. Gymnodinium capitatum Conrad & Kufferath 1954 – This species was described by Conrad and Kufferath from Belgium [18].  Their 248 word description in French was based on observations of one cell and included two line drawings and one approximate height measurement.  It has been observed in British waters [60] and in the sediments of Gwangyang Bay, South Korea [101].    
51. Gymnodinium caput Schiller 1928 – This species was described by Schiller from the Adriatic Sea and reported again later with no new observations [48,21].  The original description contained information from several cells, five drawings and quantitative cell sizes.  This species has been observed in the Mediterranean Sea [55].
52. Gymnodinium cassiei Norris 1961 – This species was described by Norris from New Zealand [102].  He used at least two cells to craft his 172 word, Latin and English description that included one image.  Basic cell size measurements were given.  It has not been observed since.
53. Gymnodinium catenatum Graham 1943 – This species was originally described by Graham from a bloom in the Gulf of California, with a 384 word description in English [103].  This species is a known producer of toxins and is thus heavily studied.  It has been observed many times all over the world [104].  There are 122 occurrence records in GBIF and 102 sequences in GenBank.  Cultures are available from the Australian National Algae Culture Collection, the Canadian Center for the Culture of Microorganisms, the Scandinavian Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa, the Microbial Culture Collection – Japan, the Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton and the Cawthron Institute Culture Collection of Microalgae.  Cultures are also held at University of Tasmania School of Plant Science Algal Culture Collection, but are not for sale.
54. Gymnodinium chiastosporum (Harris) Cridland 1958 – This species was first described as Tetrodinium chiastosporum by Harris from a freshwater pond in the UK [105].  This was based on observations of a non-motile stage.  Later, Cridland noticed, in the same location, that the motile phase of this species was a Gymnodinium, and named it Gymnodinium hippocastanum [106].  This 651 word, Latin and English description contained three drawings and quantitative morphological measurements.  Poposvky and Pfiester drew together Dinastridium chiastosporum, Gymnodinium hippocastanum, Dinastridium sexangulare and Tetradinium chiastosporum under G. chiastosporum [12].  They also mention that this species has been observed in Great Britain and the Czech Republic.  There are three records in GBIF.  
55. Gymnodinium chinensis Thessen, Patterson and Murray nom. nov. See Gymnodinium frigidum Skvortzov 1968.
56. Gymnodinium chukwanii Ballantine 1961 – This species was described by Ballantine from a freshwater fish pond in Zanzibar [107].  The 485 word, English and Latin description was based on many cells and provided four drawings and cell size measurements.  It has not been reported since.
57. Gymnodinium cinctum Kofoid & Swezy 1921 – This species was described by Kofoid and Swezy from marine waters near La Jolla, California, USA [19].  The 330 word description in English mentions finding the species three times, but the length and width measurements were not given as a range.  This suggests that either the cells were remarkably similar in size or the description was based on only one of the found individuals.  Two drawings were included.  Schiller provided a German account of the species with no new observations [21].  Wood observed the species in Australian waters and included a new drawing [95].  Hada observed the species as a cyst in Antarctic waters [108].  He gave a new drawing and measurements.  However, the images in Kofoid and Swezy and Hada do not look like the same species [19,108], Hada 1970).  That could be because Hada observed a cyst while Kofoid and Swezy observed a vegetative cell.  It is not clear how Hada knew the cyst he observed was G. cinctum Kofoid & Swezy 1921.  It has been observed in Japanese waters [109], the Mediterranean Sea [55], the Black Sea [66]and the Gulf of Mexico [56].
58. Gymnodinium cnecoides Harris 1940 – This species was described by Harris from a freshwater pond in the UK by examining one cell [105].  Popofsky and Pfiester synonymized Gymnodinium saginatum and Gymnodinium luteofaba with this species [12].  They also report that the species has been found in Great Britain and Poland.  There is one GBIF record.  It has been reported in Lake Tovel, Italy [110], a swamp in the Czech Republic [86], Lake Gölköy, Turkey [111], a bog in Wisconsin [112], and the Chesapeake Bay [47].
59. Gymnodinium cnodax Conrad & Kufferath 1954 – This species was described by Conrad and Kufferath from Belgium [18].  Their 147 word description in French was based on one cell and has one drawing.  Cell size measurements and some habitat information were given.  It has not been seen since.
60. Gymnodinium coeruleum Dogiel 1906 – This species was described by Dogiel from saline waters in the Gulf of Naples [44].  His 467 word description in German was based on observations from two cells.  It contained two drawings but no cell measurements.  This species was observed in marine waters off La Jolla, California, USA [19].  The record of the California observations was accompanied by detailed cell measurements.  Schiller reported the species with no new observations [48].  Wood observed it in Australian waters, but called it Gymnodinium coerulatum Dogiel [95].  This species should not be confused with G. coeruleum Antipova 1955 which was described from Lake Baikal, Russia and was later observed in the Angara River Basin, Russia [89,113].  Molecular data show that Gymnodinium coeruleum Antipova (GenBank # FJ024299) is closely related to Gyrodinium helveticum (Penard) Takano & Horiguchi 2004 and morphological observations also align the two entities [92]. G. coeruleum Dogiel has been observed in the Chesapeake Bay [47].
61. Gymnodinium colymbeticum Harris 1940 – This species was described by Harris from a freshwater pond in Reading, UK [105].  His 103 word, Latin and English description contained two drawings and cell size measurements.  Popovsky and Pfiester synonymized Gymnodinium pulvisculus Klebs 1912 with this species, but made no new observations [12]  They also noted that Gymnodinium pulvisculus Pouchet 1885 was not G. colymbeticum, but was a synonym of Oodinium poucheti (Lemmerman) Chatton 1912.  This species has not been observed and labeled as G. colymbeticum since its description.  However, observations of G. pulvisculus could be observations of this species or Oodinium poucheti.

63. Gymnodinium conicum Kofoid & Swezy 1921 – This species was first described as Gymnodinium viridis by Lebour from a single specimen in Plymouth Sound, England [16].  Kofoid and Swezy synonymized it with Gymnodinium conicum without making any new observations [19].  They reused the Lebour drawing in their publication and gave a 384 word, English account.  The Lebour description gave only one quantitative measurement, so the additional measurements in Kofoid and Swezy must be calculated from the drawings.  Lebour and Schiller reported the species with no new observations [20,21].  It was not until 1938 that Conrad and Kufferath observed the species in Belgium, but no new images were created [18].

He did not give a full text description, rather wrote an informative caption for one figure which does not contain cell measurements.  One cell of this species was collected and figured by Kofoid and Swezy from marine waters near La Jolla, California, USA [19].  They included an extensive morphological description, giving a range of values for the cell dimensions.  This is strange considering they only observed one individual.  Drira et al. observed the species in North African coastal waters [132].  Schiller provided a German description with no new observations [21].  There are two detailed drawings published to aid in identification of this species, but no photographs.
112. Gymnodinium gracile Bergh 1881/82 – This species was first described by Bergh in German [149].  He gave a lengthy (612 words) text description including quantitative measurements and two drawings.  Kofoid & Swezy also observed this species near La Jolla, California, USA, but called it Gymnodinium abbreviatum [19].  To add to the confusion, they include Gymnodinium gracile Bergh in their species list.  Since the Kofoid and Swezy description was in English, subsequent reports of this species were under the name Gymnodinium abbreviatum.  G. gracile Bergh has been observed world-wide [132,150,20,67,58,75] and is considered to be an oceanic species.

121. Gymnodinium hiemale (Schiller) Popovsky 1990 – This species was first described by Schiller as Massartia hiemalis from Rust, Germany during the winter [159].  He gave eight drawings of the species.  Popovsky observed the species in Austria, the Czech Republic and Switzerland and transferred it to Gymnodinium [12].  He gave a 147 word account in English with cell measurements and four new drawings.  Popovsky synonymized Katodinium hiemale (Schiller) Loeblich 1965 and Katodinium intermedium Christen 1959 with this species.  This species should not be confused with Gymnodinium hiemale Woloszynska 1917 and Gymnodinium hiemale Skvortzov 1927, both of which have been synonymized with Woloszynskia pascheri (Suchlandt) von Stosch 1973.  There are 12 observation records associated with this name in GBIF, but we are unsure to which G. hiemale concept these refer.  
122. Gymnodinium hiroshimaensis Hada 1968 – This species was first observed by Hada in Japanese waters [160].  It was referred to as Gymnodinium sp. and was accompanied by one figure.  It was not officially named until 1968 by Hada and described in English (69 words) after being observed a second time in the port of Itsukaichi, Japan [161].

126. Gymnodinium impudicum (Fraga & Bravo) Hansen & Moestrup 2000 – This species was originally described as Gyrodinium impudicum by Fraga and Bravo [163].  Hansen and Moestrup renamed it Gymnodinium impudicum based on the apical groove structure [7].  This species has been observed in Spanish waters [125], the Mexican Pacific [75] and isolated from South Korean waters (Table 1 in [164]).  Phylogenetic studies suggest that some strains of G. impudicum are really G. litoralis [164].  Sequences with GenBank numbers AF200674 and EF616465 are probably G. litoralis [164].  Cultures of this species are available from the Scandinavian Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa, the Cawthron Institute Culture Collection of Microalgae and the Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton.  Photographs are available.

269. Gymnodinium viride Penard 1891 – The species was described from Switzerland [39]. In 1990, Popovsky & Pfiester synonymized this species with Gymnodinium aeruginosum Stein. This synonymy is commonly rejected and now G. aeruginosum is a synonym of Nusuttodinium aeruginosum.
270. Gymnodinium viridescens Kofoid 1931 – This species was described by Kofoid from Mutsu Bay, Japan [67].  His 261 word description in English was based on observations of one cell and contained one drawing.  Cell measurements and habitat information was given.  Schiller reported this species in German [21].  This species has also been observed in Hong Kong (http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/water/marine_quality/files/m01_c14.pdf), Xiamen, China [252] and the Mexican Pacific [75].
271. Gymnodinium voukii Schiller 1928 – This species was described by Schiller from the Adriatic Sea [21].  His 159 word description in German was based on many cells and contained one drawing.  Cell measurements and habitat information were included.  This species has not been observed since its description.
272. Gymnodinium wawrikae Schiller 1957 – This species was described by Schiller from the freshwater Lake Neusiedl on the Austria/Hungary border [15].  His 72 word description in German was based on observations of at least two cells and contained two drawings and cell measurements.  This species was also reported from Japan [34] and Ohio, USA [85].  Eight published drawings are available.
273. Gymnodinium wilczeki Pouchet 1894 – This species was described by Pouchet from the Arctic Ocean near Spitzbergen [253].  The 205 word description in French gave one drawing, but the proportions of the drawing do not match the measurments stated in the text [19].  This species has been reported by Kofoid and Swezy, Lebour and Schiller, but observed only one other time on the east coast of the USA [19–21,62].  Only one drawing is available to aid with identification.
274. Gymnodinium wulffii Schiller 1933 – This species was described by Schiller from the Barents Sea [21].  His 85 word description in German was based on observations of at least two cells and contained five drawings.  This species has also been reported from the Bering and Chuckchi Seas [254] and eastern Russian waters [36].  This species has over 500 occurrence records in GBIF.  Published drawings and photographs are available.
275. Gymnodinium zachariasi Lemmermann 1900 – This species was described by Lemmermann from a German freshwater Lake [255].  His three word description in German featured one drawing and synonymized G. palustre Zacharias 1899 with this species.  Gymnodinium palustre Zacharias 1899 should not be confused with Gymnodinium palustre Schilling 1891 (which is now Spiniferodinium palustre Kretschmann & Gottschling 2015) and Gymnodinium palustre (Schilling) Woloszynska 1917 (which is now Biecheleria pseudopalustris (Schiller) Moestrup, Lindberg & Daugbjerg 2009. This species has also been observed in Hungary [256] and Ireland [257] as G. zachariasi.  Strains of Spiniferodinium palustre are available as G. palustre Schilling 1891 are available as from the Scandinavian Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa. The three sequences in GenBank listed as G. palustre (AB921300, AB921299, AF260382) are Spiniferodinium palustre from Japan. This species has been misspelled as G. zachariasii.
